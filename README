A few scripts I'm working on to test the consistency of data when machines
lose power.

'test-storage' is used to test that blocks fsynced to a disk actually made it
to oxide.  It does this by executing a python script on the remote system
via ssh.  That script syncs small blocks as quickly as possible, sending each
write back to the client on success.  Power is pulled from the remote system
while the test is running.  After it's been brought back online, a check can
be made against the remote file to identify any syncs that returned success
but failed to survive the reboot.
