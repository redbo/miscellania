This has become sort of my dumpsite for miscellaneous scripts and stuff.




'test-sync' is used to test that blocks fsynced to a disk actually made it
to oxide.  It does this by executing a python script on the remote system
via ssh.  That script syncs small blocks as quickly as possible, sending each
write back to the client on success.  Power is pulled from the remote system
while the test is running.  After it's been brought back online, a check can
be made against the remote file to identify any syncs that returned success
but failed to survive the reboot.

'test-file' performs the write-fsync-rename operation as fast as possible in
a tight loop.  It also applies an xattr to each file that should relate to the
file's contents.  Power should be pulled from a machine while this test is
running, then after it's brought back up, a thorough audit of all files and
their contents and extended attributes can be performed.
